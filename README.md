# QRCodeBlot

This repository contains the work behind my Hack Club [blot](https://github.com/hackclub/blot) submission: https://github.com/hackclub/blot/pull/803.
## Features
- **Scannable Art**: By changing `textToEncode` you can encode your own text
- **All QR Versions Supported**: By changing the appropriate variables in accordance with the [tables](https://www.thonky.com/qr-code-tutorial/error-correction-table) provided on Thonky's QR Tutorial, you can encode data in any version from 1 all the way up to 40. (Additionally, see the [Helpful Tables](#helpful-tables) section)
- **Fully Customizable Presets**: A preset may be selected by changing the `PRESET` variable to any integer greater than `0`. You can add your own presets by modifying the presets array.
- **Completely Random Mode**: A completely random QR inspired art piece can be generated by setting `PRESET` to `0`.

> Left: snapshot-1.png which was generated with scannability in mind. **Pull out your phone and try scanning it** ðŸ˜„ 

> Right: snapshot-2.png which was optimized for being drawn by the blot. Most phones will identify it as a QR code, but fail to scan it.

## Helpful Tables

### QR Code Generation Parameters
This table may help select the correct values for the QR code constants. Here is an example:
```js
const encodeVersion = 2;          // https://www.thonky.com/qr-code-tutorial/character-capacities
const errorCorrectionLevel = "M"; // L (7%), M (15%), Q (25%), H (30%)
const requiredBits = 28 * 8;      // "Data Codewords" https://www.thonky.com/qr-code-tutorial/error-correction-table
const errorCorrectionBytes = 16;  // "EC Codewords Per Block" https://www.thonky.com/qr-code-tutorial/error-correction-table
```
A full table can be found by visiting [Thonky.com's QR Tutorial](https://www.thonky.com/qr-code-tutorial/error-correction-table).
